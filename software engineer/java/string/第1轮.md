# String

## 1. **How to compare strings? Use "==" or use equals()?**

In brief, "==" tests if references are equal and equals() tests if values are equal. Unless you want to check if two strings are the same object, you should always use equals().

## **2. Why is char[] preferred over String for security sensitive information?**

[Strings are immutable](https://www.programcreek.com/2009/02/diagram-to-show-java-strings-immutability/), which means once they are created, they will stay unchanged until Garbage Collector kicks in. With an array, you can explicitly change its elements. In this way, security sensitive information(e.g. password) will not be present anywhere in the system.

## **3. Can we use string for switch statement?**

Yes to version 7. From [JDK 7](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk7/features/), we can use string as switch condition. Before version 6, we can not use string as switch condition.

## **4. How to convert string to int?**

```java
int n = Integer.parseInt("10");
```

## **5. How to split a string with white space characters?**

```java
String[] strArray = aString.split("\\s+");
```

## **6. What substring() method really does?**

In JDK 6, the substring() method gives a window to an array of chars which represents the existing String, but do not create a new one. To create a new string represented by a new char array, you can do add an empty string like the following:

```java
str.substring(m, n) + ""
```

This will create a new char array that represents the new string. The above approach sometimes can make your code faster, because Garbage Collector can collect the unused large string and keep only the sub string.

In Oracle JDK 7, substring() creates a new char array, not uses the existing one. Check out the diagram for showing [substring() difference between JDK 6 and JDK 7](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/09/the-substring-method-in-jdk-6-and-jdk-7/).

## **7. String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer**

String vs StringBuilder: StringBuilder is mutable, which means you can modify it after its creation.
StringBuilder vs StringBuffer: StringBuffer is synchronized, which means it is thread-safe but slower than StringBuilder.

## **8. How to repeat a string?**

In Python, we can just multiply a number to repeat a string. In Java, we can use the repeat() method of StringUtils from Apache Commons Lang package.

```java
String str = "abcd";
String repeated = StringUtils.repeat(str,3);
//abcdabcdabcd
```

## **9. How to convert string to date?**

```java
String str = "Sep 17, 2013";
Date date = new SimpleDateFormat("MMMM d, yy", Locale.ENGLISH).parse(str);
System.out.println(date);
//Tue Sep 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013
```

## **10. How to count # of occurrences of a character in a string?**

Use StringUtils from apache commons lang.

```java
int n = StringUtils.countMatches("11112222", "1");
System.out.println(n);
```

In summary, once a string is created in [memory](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/04/jvm-run-time-data-areas/)(heap), it can not be changed. All methods of String do not change the string itself, but rather return a new String.

If we need a string that can be modified, we will need *StringBuffer* or *StringBuilder*. Otherwise, there would be a lot of time wasted for Garbage Collection, since each time a new String is created. [Here](https://www.programcreek.com/2011/11/java-read-file-into-a-string/) is an example of using *StringBuilder*.

## 13. [Why String is immutable in Java?](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/04/why-string-is-immutable-in-java/)

`String` is immutable in Java. An immutable class is simply a class whose instances cannot be modified. All information in an instance is initialized when the instance is created and the information can not be modified. There are many advantages of immutable classes. This article summarizes why [`String` is designed to be immutable](https://www.programcreek.com/2009/02/diagram-to-show-java-strings-immutability/). This post illustrate the immutability concept in the perspective of memory, synchronization and data structures.

### **1. Requirement of String Pool**

String pool (String intern pool) is a special storage area in

Method Area

. When a string is created and if the string already exists in the pool, the reference of the existing string will be returned, instead of creating a new object.

```java
String string1 = "abcd";
String string2 = "abcd";
```

![](https://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/java-string-pool.jpeg)

If a string is mutable, changing the string with one reference will lead to the wrong value for the other references.

### **2. Caching Hashcode**

The hashcode of a string is frequently used in Java. For example, in a HashMap or HashSet. Being immutable guarantees that hashcode will always be the same so that it can be cashed without worrying about the changes.That means, there is no need to calculate hashcode every time it is used. This is more efficient.

In String class, it has the following code:

```java
private int hash;//this is used to cache hash code.
```

### **3. Facilitating the Use of Other Objects**

To make this concrete, consider the following program:

```java
HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<String>();
set.add(new String("a"));
set.add(new String("b"));
set.add(new String("c"));
 
for(String a: set)
	a.value = "a";
```

In this example, if String is mutable, its value can be changed which would violate the design of set (set contains unduplicated elements). Of curse, the example above is just for demonstration purpose and there is no `value` field in a real string class.

### **4. Security**

String is widely used as a parameter for many java classes, e.g. network connection, opening files, etc. Were String not immutable, a connection or file would be changed and this can lead to a serious security threat. The method thought it was connecting to one machine, but was not. Mutable strings could cause a security problem in Reflection too, as the parameters are strings.

### **5. Immutable objects are naturally thread-safe**

Because immutable objects can not be changed, they can be shared among multiple threads freely. This eliminates the requirements of doing synchronization.

In summary, `String` is designed to be immutable for efficiency and security reasons. This is also the reason why immutable classes are preferred in many cases in general.

# 14. [Create Java String Using ” ” or Constructor?](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/03/create-java-string-by-double-quotes-vs-by-constructor/)

### **1. Double Quotes vs. Constructor**

This question can be answered by using two simple examples.

Example 1:

```java
String a = "abcd";
String b = "abcd";
System.out.println(a == b);  // True
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // True
```

`a==b` is true because `a` and `b` are referring to the same string literal in the [method area](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/04/jvm-run-time-data-areas/). The memory references are the same.

When the same string literal is created more than once, only one copy of each distinct string value is stored. This is called "*string interning*". All compile-time constant strings in Java are automatically interned.

Example 2:

```java
String c = new String("abcd");
String d = new String("abcd");
System.out.println(c == d);  // False
System.out.println(c.equals(d)); // True
```

`c==d` is false because `c` and `d` refer to two different objects in the heap. Different objects always have different memory references.

This diagram illustrate the two situations above:

![](https://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/constructor-vs-double-quotes-Java-String-New-Page-650x324.png)

### **2. Run-Time String Interning**

String interning can still be done at run-time, even if two strings are constructed with constructors:

```java
String c = new String("abcd").intern();
String d = new String("abcd").intern();
System.out.println(c == d); // Now true
System.out.println(c.equals(d)); // True
```

### **3. When to Use Which**

Because the literal "abcd" is already of type String, using constructor will create an extra unnecessary object. Therefore, double quotes should be used if you just need to create a String.

If you do need to create a new object in the heap, constructor should be used. [Here](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/09/the-substring-method-in-jdk-6-and-jdk-7/) is a use case.

## 15. [String is passed by “reference” in Java](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/09/string-is-passed-by-reference-in-java/)

This is a classic question of Java. Many similar questions have been asked on stackoverflow, and there are a lot of incorrect/incomplete answers. The question is simple if you don't think too much. But it could be very confusing, if you give more thought to it.

### **1. A code fragment that is interesting & confusing**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	String x = new String("ab");
	change(x);
	System.out.println(x);
}
 
public static void change(String x) {
	x = "cd";
}
```

It prints "ab".

### **2. Common confusing questions**

*x* stores the reference which points to the "ab" string in the heap. So when *x* is passed as a parameter to the *change()* method, it still points to the "ab" in the heap like the following:

![](https://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/string-pass-by-reference--650x247.jpeg)

Because java is pass-by-value, the value of *x* is the reference to "ab". When the method *change()* gets invoked, it creates a new "cd" object, and *x* now is pointing to "cd" like the following:

![](https://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/string-pass-by-reference-2-650x247.jpeg)

It seems to be a pretty reasonable explanation. They are clear that Java is always pass-by-value. But what is wrong here?

### **3. What the code really does?**

The explanation above has several mistakes. To understand this easily, it is a good idea to briefly walk though the whole process.

When the string "ab" is created, Java allocates the amount of memory required to store the string object. Then, the object is assigned to variable *x*, the variable is actually assigned a reference to the object. This reference is the address of the memory location where the object is stored.

The variable *x* contains a reference to the string object. *x* is not a reference itself! It is a variable that stores a reference(memory address).

Java is pass-by-value ONLY. When x is passed to the change() method, a copy of value of x (a reference) is passed. The method *change()* creates another object "cd" and it has a different reference. It is the variable x that changes its reference(to "cd"), not the reference itself.

The following diagram shows what it really does.

![](https://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/string-pass-by-reference-3-650x244.jpeg)

## 16. [Start from length & length() in Java](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/11/start-from-length-length-in-java/)

First of all, can you quickly answer the following question?

>Without code autocompletion of any IDE, how to get the length of an array? And how to get the length of a String?

I asked this question to developers of different levels: entry and intermediate. They can not answer the question correctly or confidently. While IDE provides convenient code autocompletion, it also brings the problem of "surface understanding". In this post, I will explain some key concepts about Java arrays.

The answer:

```java
int[] arr = new int[3];
System.out.println(arr.length);//length for array
 
String str = "abc";
System.out.println(str.length());//length() for string
```

The question is why array has the length field but string does not? Or why string has the length() method while array does not?

### **Q1. Why arrays have length property?**

First of all, an array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. After an array is created, its length never changes[1]. The array's length is available as a final instance variable length. Therefore, length can be considered as a defining attribute of an array.

An array can be created by two methods: 1) an array creation expression and 2) an array initializer. When it is created, the size is specified.

An array creation expression is used in the example above. It specifies the element type, the number of levels of nested arrays, and the length of the array for at least one of the levels of nesting.

This declaration is also legal, since it specifies one of the levels of nesting.

### **Q2. Why there is not a class "Array" defined similarly like "String"?**

Since an array is an object, the following code is legal.

```java
Object obj = new int[10];
```

An array contains all the members inherited from class Object(except clone). Why there is not a class definition of an array? We can not find an Array.java file. A rough explanation is that they're hidden from us. You can think about the question - if there IS a class Array, what would it look like? It would still need an array to hold the array data, right? Therefore, it is not a good idea to define such a class.

### **Q3. Why String has length() method?**

The backup data structure of a String is a char array. There is no need to define a field that is not necessary for every application. Unlike C, an Array of characters is not a String in Java.

## 17. [What exactly is null in Java?](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/12/what-exactly-is-null-in-java/)

Let's start from the following statement:

```java
String x = null;
```

### **1. What exactly does this statement do?**

Recall what is a variable and what is a value. A common metaphor is that a variable is similar to a box. Just as you can use a box to store something, you can use a variable to store a value. When declaring a variable, we need to set its type.

There are two major categories of types in Java: primitive and reference. Variables declared of a primitive type store values; variables declared of a reference type store references. In this case, the initialization statement declares a variables “x”. “x” stores String reference. It is null here.

The following visualization gives a better sense about this concept.

![](https://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/what-is-null-150x150.png)

If x = "abc", it looks like the following:

![](https://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/variable-reference-300x144.png)

### **2. What exactly is null in memory?**

What exactly is null in memory? Or What is the null value in Java?

First of all, null is not a valid object instance, so there is no memory allocated for it. It is simply a value that indicates that the object reference is not currently referring to an object.

### **3. What exactly is x in memory?**

Now we know what null is. And we know a variable is a storage location and an associated symbolic name (an identifier) which contains some value. Where exactly x is in memory?

From [the diagram of JVM run-time data areas](https://www.programcreek.com/2013/04/jvm-run-time-data-areas/), we know that since each method has a private stack frame within the thread's stack, the local variable are located on that frame.
